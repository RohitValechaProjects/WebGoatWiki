# What is WebGoat?
 
WebGoat is a deliberately insecure application that allows interested developers
just like you to *test vulnerabilities* commonly found in Java-based
applications that use common and popular open source components.

Now, while we in no way condone causing intentional harm to any animal, goat or
otherwise, we think learning everything you can about security vulnerabilities
is essential to understanding just what happens when even a small bit of
*unintended code gets into your applications*.

What better way to do that than with your very own scapegoat?

Feel free to do what you will with Hack. Poke, prod and if it makes you feel
better, scare him until your heartâ€™s content. *Go ahead, and Hack the goat*. We
promise he likes it.

Thanks for your interest!
