### This is a work in progress and is still being updated with the full list of solutions. You're welcome to add your own!

These solutions are intended for use with WebGoat Version 8

***

## SQL Injection (advanced), Lesson 3 Exercise
To dump the user_system_data table and view Dave's password, submit the following in the "Name" form: <br>
`name'; select * from user_system_data;--` <br>
Now that the table has been dumped, observe dave's password and enter it in the password text field

## SQL Injection, Lesson 7 Exercise
In "Account Name" form, enter:
`Smith' or '1'='1`

## SQL Injection, Lesson 8 Exercise
`123 or 1=1`

## XXE, Lesson 3 Exercise
Enter and submit a comment. Using a web proxy (e.g. OWASP ZAP), observe the XML in the body of the request. Resend the request, but first edit the XML in the body to something like: <br>
`<?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE comment [ <!ENTITY rootpath SYSTEM "file:///"> ]> <comment><text>&rootpath;</text></comment>`

## XXE, Lesson 4 Exercise
Enter and submit a comment. Using a web proxy (e.g. OWASP ZAP), note how the request body has changed from the previous exercise (Lesson 3), while the webpage looks very similar. We can attempt the same result as Lesson 3 with the identical request body: <br>
`<?xml version="1.0"?> <!DOCTYPE comment [ <!ENTITY rootpath SYSTEM "file:///"> ]> <comment><text>&rootpath;</text></comment>` <br>
But as the response suggests, we can't submit XML when the Content-Type is `application/json`. We can fix this problem by changing the Content-Type to `application/xml`, and sending the above XML as before.

## Authentication Bypass, Lesson 2 Exercise
Enter values into both security question forms and click the Submit button. Using a web proxy (e.g. OWASP ZAP), observe the http request sent by the client. Edit the `secQuestion0` variable name to `secQuestion2` and change the `secQuestion1` variable to `secQuestion3` and resend the request

## Cross Site Scripting, Lesson 2 Exercise
Yes

## Cross Site Scripting, Lesson 7 Exercise
After using the default data entries, observe that the user-filled credit card number is reflected to the user in the webpage's thank you message. Replace the credit card number with the following javascript: <br>
`<script>alert('This is an example of reflected XSS')</script>`

## Insecure Direct Object Reference, Lesson 2 Exercise
Use the provided credentials to login <br>
user: `tom` <br>
pass: `cat`

## Insecure Direct Object Reference, Lesson 3 Exercise
Click the "View Profile" button.
Using a web proxy (e.g. OWASP ZAP), observe the body of the server's response to the profile request.
Enter the two extra attributes seen in the web proxy (comma delimited): <br>
`userId, role`

**NOTE:** a bug may cause the "3" for Lesson 3 to remain red (indicating incompleteness) instead of green (indicating completeness)

## Insecure Direct Object Reference, Lesson 4 Exercise
We can observe that in Lesson 3, the profile request was directed at WebGoat/IDOR/profile
We can infer that in order to request a specific profile, a unique profile attribute may be appended to this URL, so using the userId from the previous answer, enter: <br>
`WebGoat/IDOR/profile/2342384`

## Insecure Login, Lesson 2 Exercise
Using a web proxy (e.g. OWASP ZAP), observe the request transmitted after the Log in button is clicked. The body of the captured request contains: <br>
`{"username":"CaptainJack","password":"BlackPearl"}`

**NOTE:** a bug may cause the "2" for Lesson 2 to remain red (indicating incompleteness) instead of green (indicating completeness)

## Cross-Site Request Forgeries, Lesson 3 Exercise
Click the "Submit Query" button. Observe the URL of the page that opens includes a field titled "csrf". Modify the URL to the following and view the message: <br>
`http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/csrf/basic-get-flag?csrf=true&submit=Submit+Query` <br>
The flag is on the webpage when the correct URL (the line above) is accessed in a separate window/tab

## Cross-Site Request Forgeries, Lesson 4 Exercise
Make a fake .html file locally to act as a webpage. The .html file will include hidden form fields, such as the following. Remember to replace the "validateReq" token value with your own value! <br>
`<html><body><form action="http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/csrf/review" method="POST"><input type="hidden" name="reviewText" value="Amazing Review"><input type="hidden" name="stars" value="5"><input type="hidden" name="validateReq" value="2aa14227b9a13d0bede0388a7fba9aa9"></form> <script>document.forms[0].submit();</script></body></html>` <br>
Now open this webpage in the same browser as while logged in to your webgoat account

## Bypass front-end restrictions, Lesson 2 Exercise
If you are using a recent version of Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, right click one of the input fields and select "Inspect Element" from the menu. In the HTML inspector, modify the four input fields to:
* Add a third option named "option3" to the selection menu and select it
* Add a third radio button with a value of "option3" and select it
* Change the checkbox input type field to "text" and enter some text
* Adjust the text input field maxlength variable to a value greater than the default value of 5 and add extra characters to the input value

## Bypass Front-End Restrictions, Lesson 3 Exercise
Submit the form using the default values. Then, using a web proxy (e.g. OWASP ZAP), edit the request with the web proxy and modify the values of the fields to values that do not fit the regular expressions. For example, the following request body will work: <br>
`field1=Zabc&field2=Z123&field3=*abc+123+ABC&field4=Zseven&field5=Z01101&field6=Z90210-1111&field7=Z301-604-4882&error=0`

## Client Side Filtering, Lesson 2 Exercise
Select any employee name from the menu. Using a web proxy (e.g. OWASP ZAP), observe that the response from the server includes the full details (salary, UserID, SSN) for all users, including the CEO, Neville Bartholomew. Enter Neville's salary into the submission box 

## Client Side Filtering, Lesson 3
Enter a random value for the "Checkout Code" and click the "Buy" button and observe the request using a web proxy (e.g. OWASP ZAP). Two requests are made - one to `clientSideFiltering/challenge-store/coupons/` and one to `clientSideFiltering/getItForFree/whatever-you-wrote-for-checkout-code`. By accessing the latter URL with an empty value for the checkout code, like so: <br>
`http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/clientSideFiltering/challenge-store/coupons/` <br>
We can see all the possible coupon codes, and determine that "get_it_for_free" provides a 100% discount

## HTML Tampering, Lesson 2
Right click the "Checkout" button and select "Inspect Element" from the right click menu. Observe that within the HTML source, below the button, is a hiden input field. Modify the value of this hidden input to a cost below 2999. Then click the green "Checkout" button.
