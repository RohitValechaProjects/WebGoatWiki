### This is a work in progress and is still being updated with the full list of solutions. You're welcome to add your own!

These solutions are intended for use with WebGoat Version 8

***

## SQL Injection, Lesson 7 Exercise
In "Account Name" form, enter:
`Smith' or '1'='1`

## SQL Injection, Lesson 8 Exercise
`123 or 1=1`

## Authentication Bypass, Lesson 2 Exercise
Enter values into both security question forms and click the Submit button.
Using a web proxy (e.g. OWASP ZAP), observe the http request sent by the client.
Edit the `secQuestion0` variable name to `secQuestion2` and change the `secQuestion1` variable to `secQuestion3` and resend the request

## Cross Site Scripting, Lesson 2 Exercise
Yes

## Cross Site Scripting, Lesson 7 Exercise
After using the default data entries, observe that the user-filled credit card number is reflected to the user in the webpage's thank you message.
Replace the credit card number with the following javascript:
`<script>alert('This is an example of reflected XSS')</script>`

## Insecure Direct Object Reference, Lesson 2 Exercise
Use the provided credentials to login
user: `tom`
pass: `cat`

## Insecure Direct Object Reference, Lesson 3 Exercise
Click the "View Profile" button.
Using a web proxy (e.g. OWASP ZAP), observe the body of the server's response to the profile request.
Enter the two extra attributes seen in the web proxy (comma delimited):
`userId, role`

**NOTE:** a bug may cause the "3" for Lesson 3 to remain red (indicating incompleteness) instead of green (indicating completeness)

## Insecure Direct Object Reference, Lesson 4 Exercise
We can observe that in Lesson 3, the profile request was directed at WebGoat/IDOR/profile
We can infer that in order to request a specific profile, a unique profile attribute may be appended to this URL, so using the userId from the previous answer, enter:
`WebGoat/IDOR/profile/2342384`

## Insecure Login, Lesson 2 Exercise
Using a web proxy (e.g. OWASP ZAP), observe the request transmitted after the Log in button is clicked. The body of the captured request contains:
`{"username":"CaptainJack","password":"BlackPearl"}`

**NOTE:** a bug may cause the "2" for Lesson 2 to remain red (indicating incompleteness) instead of green (indicating completeness)
