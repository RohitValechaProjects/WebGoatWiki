## Solve The Lesson

Always start with the lesson plan. Then try to solve the lesson and if necessary, use the hints. The last hint is the solution text if applicable. If you cannot solve the lesson using the hints, you may view the solution for complete details.

## Read And Edit Parameters/Cookies

To read and edit parameters and cookies you need a local proxy like OWASP ZAP to intercept the HTTP request. More information on ZAP can be found in the "Useful Tools" section in the Introduction.
